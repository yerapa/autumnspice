<h1>About Us</h1>
We opened Conscious Cup Coffee Roasters in 2006, in a small cafe and drive-thru in Crystal Lake IL. We jumped into the
coffee industry head first. There were some things we all really cared about. First, we wanted to find, roast, and sell
the absolute best coffees we could get our hands on.

    Autumn Spice has been a caring company from the very beginning. We care about who we are, who we serve and what we
    do.

    Coffee shops occupy an important space in many of our lives because of their unique ability to fulfill so many of
    our needs: socializing, studying, working, resting, reading â€” in an atmosphere that suits our tastes and makes us
    feel like we belong. At their best, coffee shops are places that meet the needs of a community, while giving
    communities the space they need to get together.

    Autumn Spice offers a unique coffee house environment unlike any other. We are not only a place to drop in and get
    your morning cup of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where you can sit down
    and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. Let our professional baristas create a wonderful experience just for you.
