                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>
                    We opened Autumn Spice in 2006, in a small cafe and drive-thru in Crystal Lake IL. We jumped into
                    the coffee industry head first. There were some things we all really cared about. First, we wanted
                    to
                    find,
                    roast,
                    and sell the absolute best coffees we could get our hands on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Autumn Spice has been a caring company from the very beginning. We care about who we are, who we
                    serve
                    and what
                    we
                    do.
                </p>

                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>
                    Coffee shops occupy an important space in many of our lives because of their unique ability to
                    fulfill
                    so many
                    of
                    our needs: socializing, studying, working, resting, reading â€” in an atmosphere that suits our tastes
                    and
                    makes
                    us
                    feel like we belong. At their best, coffee shops are places that meet the needs of a community,
                    while
                    giving
                    communities the space they need to get together.

                    Autumn Spice offers a unique coffee house environment unlike any other. We are not only a place to
                    drop
                    in and
                    get
                    your morning cup of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where you
                    can
                    sit
                    down
                    and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. Let our professional baristas create a wonderful
                    experience
                    just for
                    you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We serve coffee, but we're not your typical coffee shop. We also serve great food in an atmosphere
                    where
                    conversation blooms and individuals or families alike come to enjoy their time. We make a conscious
                    effort to provide for and engage with the local community.
