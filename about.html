            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                We opened Autumn Spice in 2006, in a small cafe and drive-thru in Crystal Lake IL. We jumped into
                the coffee industry head first. There were some things we all really cared about. First, we wanted to
                find,
                roast,
                and sell the absolute best coffees we could get our hands on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Autumn Spice has been a caring company from the very beginning. We care about who we are, who we serve
                and what
                we
                do.
            </p>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>
                Coffee shops occupy an important space in many of our lives because of their unique ability to fulfill
                so many
                of
                our needs: socializing, studying, working, resting, reading â€” in an atmosphere that suits our tastes and
                makes
                us
                feel like we belong. At their best, coffee shops are places that meet the needs of a community, while
                giving
                communities the space they need to get together.

                Autumn Spice offers a unique coffee house environment unlike any other. We are not only a place to drop
                in and
                get
                your morning cup of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where you can
                sit
                down
                and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. Let our professional baristas create a wonderful experience
                just for
                you.
            </p>
            <p>
                We serve coffee, but we're not your typical coffee shop. We also serve great food in an atmosphere where
                conversation blooms and individuals or families alike come to enjoy their time. We make a conscious
                effort to provide for and engage with the local community.
            </p>
